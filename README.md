# Robotic-Arm
The first step of this task was formulating or designing the interface. So, we created 6 engines for the robot, each engine has a range slider from 0-90 degrees with two buttons for saving and run. The visual studio code was used to write the program by using HTML, JavaScript, and PHP languages. In addition, we have used the CSS language to style the HTML document. The PhpMyAdmin was used to create the database. 6 rows and 4 columns were created in the database) (id, engine name, engine range, status (on-off)). We have connected the database to the control interface by using a save button. When the user clicks on the save button, the information of each engine will be sent to the database. After clicking on the save button, the user will press the run button, which will open another PHP page that will show the user stored information in the database for each engine (engine name and engine degree and the status of the engine (on-off)).
